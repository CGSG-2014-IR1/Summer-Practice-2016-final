  <p>Figures description</p>
  <ul>
    <li>King - your main figure. He cannot attack and very slow, but if you lose him, you lose the game.</li>
    <li>Queen - looks like strongest figure on board. She has strong attack, average range and good health.</li>
    <li>Mage - your sniper. He has EXTREME range, but weak attack. Also he's pretty slow and is not tough. Use him to harrass your enemies.</li>
    <li>Slayer - very tricky figure. He's slow and will be killed by any attack, but has very high damage. If you manage to protect slayers from ranged attacks, you will rule the battlefield.</li>
    <li>Knight - your first and last defenders. They are fast and strong, but not tough enough to tank. Use the as defence, finishers or scouts.</li>
    <li>Tower - the juggernaut. Tough and slow. That's it</li>
    <li>Pawn - the cannon fodder. Pretty slow and weak. Still it's many of them.</li>
  </ul>
